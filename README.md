# Realtime Chat Application

## Introduction
This is a code repository for the web technology project. We have created a realtime chat application using Reactjs and Nodejs

Setup:
- Start the backend server first
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
- Add the URL of your backend server in the client/src/config.js file to set the path for API requests
- Format of the config.js file should be as follows:
```
export const ENDPOINT='<YOUR_BACKEND_URL>'
```
